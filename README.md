## Overview
This is a console-based Baccarat game developed in C++ by Kevin Villania. The game simulates a virtual casino where a player can bet on either the banker or player, and cards are drawn to determine the winner based on the Baccarat rules. The game is played with numeric cards (1â€“10) and the goal is to get a sum closest to 9.

## Features
- Fully functional CLI-based Baccarat game
- Player can bet on either Banker or Player
- Automatic calculation of winner based on Baccarat rules
- Random card generation simulating a shuffled deck
- Support for replays and session money tracking

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (like g++)
- Windows Command Line or compatible terminal

### Compilation
```bash
g++ baccarat_game.cpp -o baccarat_game.exe
```

### Running the Game
```bash
./baccarat_game.exe
```

## Usage
- Enter your name to begin.
- Choose to bet on BANKER (1) or PLAYER (2).
- Enter a bet amount.
- View the drawn cards and determine the result.
- Play again or exit based on your choice.

## Code Breakdown
### 1. Struct Declaration
```cpp
struct Number {
    int num1, num2, sum, extraCard;
};
```
Holds the details for two main cards, their sum, and an optional third card if needed.

### 2. Main Function
Initializes the game, handles input/output, and loops through the game round-by-round until the user quits or runs out of money.

### 3. Card Drawing Logic
```cpp
banker.num1 = rand() % 10 + 1;
banker.num2 = rand() % 10 + 1;
banker.sum = (banker.num1 + banker.num2) % 10;
```
Simulates two card draws and checks for a natural win (8 or 9). If not a natural win, an extra card is drawn and added.

### 4. Display Functions
```cpp
void printCard1(...)
void printCard2(...)
```
- `printCard1` shows three cards including extra.
- `printCard2` is used if the hand is a natural win and shows only two cards.

### 5. Game Result Evaluation
```cpp
int winnerFunction(int bankerCard, int playerCard);
```
- Compares totals and returns 1 (Banker), 2 (Player), or 3 (Draw).

### 6. Score Calculation
```cpp
int declareWinner(...);
```
- Evaluates the bet and updates player balance based on the winner.

### 7. Play Again Logic
```cpp
bool playAgain(...);
```
- Returns `true` or `false` based on player's input and remaining money.

### Presentation Tips for Students
- **Purpose:** Showcase your understanding of control structures, randomness, and function-driven design in C++.
- **Highlight Concepts:** Emphasize card logic, random number generation, and input validation.
- **Interactively Demo:** Let the professor or peers interact with the game during demo time.
